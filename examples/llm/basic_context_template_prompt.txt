Give me $COUNT$ different Java implementations of this method body, optimising it for runtime efficiency:```
$DESTINATION$
```
This code belongs to project $PROJECT$, where given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k].
If no such indices exists, return false.

$CONTEXT$

Wrap all code in curly braces, if it is not already. Do not include any method or class declarations or any explanations. Label all code as java.
