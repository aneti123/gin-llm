Give me $COUNT$ different Java implementations of this method body:```
$DESTINATION$
```
This code belongs to project $PROJECT$.

Last time you suggested:```
$PREVIOUS$
```
but I got this error:```
$ERROR$
```

Wrap all code in curly braces, if it is not already. Do not include any method or class declarations. Label all code as java.
