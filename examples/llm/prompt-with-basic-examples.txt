Please give me $COUNT$ different Java implementations of this method body:

```
$DESTINATION$
```

This code belongs to project $PROJECT$.

I will give you three examples of structural changes you could try. If you have this code:

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int sum = 0;

for (int num : numbers) {
    sum += num;
}
```

Example 1: You could try using a while loop instead of a for loop:

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int sum = 0;
int i = 0;

while (i < numbers.length) {
    sum += numbers[i];
    i++;
}
```

Example 2: You could try using Streams:

```
import java.util.Arrays;

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int sum = Arrays.stream(numbers).sum();
```

Example 3: You could try variating the loop indices: 

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int sum = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}
```
